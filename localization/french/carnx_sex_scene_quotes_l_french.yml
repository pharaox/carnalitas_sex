 carnx_sex_scene_quote_30a: "Praise be given to God, who has placed man's greatest pleasure in the natural parts of woman, and has destined the natural parts of man to afford the greatest enjoyment to woman.\n\nHe has not endowed the parts of woman with any pleasurable or satisfactory feeling until the same have been penetrated by the instrument of the male; and likewise the sexual organs of man know neither rest nor quietness until they have entered those of the female.\n\nHence the mutual operation. There takes place between the two actors wrestling, intertwinings, a kind of animated conflict. Owing to the contact of the lower parts of the two bellies, the enjoyment soon comes to pass. The man is at work as with a pestle, while the woman seconds him by lascivious movements; finally comes the ejaculation."
 carnx_sex_scene_quote_30b: "The kiss on the mouth, on the two cheeks, upon the neck, as well as the sucking up of flesh lips, are gifts of God, destined to provoke erection at the favourable moment. God also is it who has embellished the chest of the woman with breasts, has furnished her with a double chin, and has given brilliant colours to her cheeks.\n\nHe has also gifted her with eyes that inspire love, and with eyelashes like polished blades.\n\nHe has furnished her with a rounded belly and a beautiful navel, and with a majestic crupper; and all these wonders are borne up by the thighs. It is between these latter that God has placed the arena of the combat; when the same is provided with ample flesh, it resembles the head of a lion. It is called the vulva. Oh! how many men's deaths lie at her door? Amongst them how many heroes!"
 carnx_sex_scene_quote_30c: "Then the Almighty has plunged woman into a sea of splendours, of voluptuousness, and of delights, and covered her with precious vestments, with brilliant girdles and provoking smiles.\n\nSo let us praise and exalt him who has created woman and her beauties, with her appetizing flesh; who has given her hails, a beautiful figure, a bosom with breasts which are swelling, and amorous ways, which awaken desires."

He walked after her till she had entered her boudoir. Then she threw herself on a couch of silk, which was rounded on the top like a vault, lifted her clothes up over her thighs, trembling all over, and all the beauty which God had given her was in Bahloul's arms."
 carnx_sex_scene_quote_35b: "Then he laid himself down in the position the woman takes in receiving a man; and his verge was standing up like a column.\n\nHamdonna threw herself upon Bahloul, took his member between her hands and began to look at it. She was astonished at its size, strength and firmness, and cried: 'Here we have the ruin of all women and the cause of many troubles. O Bahloul! I never saw a more beautiful dart than yours!' Still she continued keeping hold of it, and rubbed its bead against the lips of her vulva till the latter part seemed to say: 'O member, come into me.'"
 carnx_sex_scene_quote_35c: "Then Bahloul inserted his member into the vagina of the Sultan's daughter, and she, settling down upon his engine, allowed it to penetrate entirely into her furnace till nothing more could be seen of it, not the slightest trace, and she said: 'How lascivious has God made woman, and how indefatigable after her pleasures.' She then gave herself up to an up-and-down dance, moving her bottom like a riddle; to the right and left, and forward and backward; never was there such a dance as this.\n\nThe Sultan's daughter continued her ride upon Bahloul's member till the moment of enjoyment arrived, and the attraction of the vulva seemed to pump the member as though by suction: just as an infant sucks the teat of the mother. The acme of enjoyment came to both simultaneously, and each took the pleasure with avidity."
 carnx_sex_scene_quote_35d: "Then she undressed until she was quite naked, and Bahloul fell into an ecstasy on seeing the beauty and perfection of her form. He looked at her magnificent thighs and rebounding navel, at her belly vaulted like an arch, her plump breasts standing out like hyacinths. Her neck was like a gazelle's, the opening of her mouth like a ring, her lips fresh and red like a gory sabre. Her teeth might have been taken for pearls and her cheeks for roses. Her eyes were black and well slit, and her eyebrows of ebony resembled the rounded flourish of the noun traced by the hand of a skilful writer. Her forehead was like the full moon in the night."
 carnx_sex_scene_quote_35e: "Bahloul began to embrace her, to suck her lips and to kiss her bosom; he drew her fresh saliva and bit her thighs. So he went on till she was ready to swoon, and could scarcely stammer, and her eyes became veiled. Then he kissed her vulva, and she moved neither hand nor foot. He looked lovingly upon the secret parts of Hamdonna, beautiful enough to attract all eyes with their purple centre.\n\nBahloul cried, 'Oh, the temptation of man!' and still he bit her and kissed her till her desire was roused to its full pitch. Her sighs came quicker, and grasping his member with her hand she made it disappear in her vagina\n\nThen it was he who moved hard, and she who responded hotly, the overwhelming pleasure simultaneously calming their fervour."

Then introduce your member, and at the moment of ejaculation draw her towards you. This position is painful for the woman, for her thighs being bent upwards and her buttocks raised by the cushion, the walls of her vagina tighten, and the uterus tending forward there is not much room for movement, and scarcely space enough for the intruder; consequently the latter enters with difficulty and strikes against the uterus. This position should therefore not be adopted, unless the man's member is short or soft."

In this position the two thighs of the woman are pressed against the man's flanks, and she puts her arms round his neck. Then the man clasps the woman's ankles, and drawing his feet nearer to his body, brings the woman, who is sitting on them, within range of his member, which then enters her vagina. By moving his feet he sends her back and brings her forward again, without ever withdrawing his member entirely.\n\nThe woman makes herself as light as possible, and assists as well as she can in this come-and-go movement; her co-operation is, in fact, indispensable for it. If the man apprehends that his member may come out entirely, he takes her round the waist, and she receives no other impulse than that which is imparted to her by the feet of the man upon which she is sitting."

While the woman is lying on her right side, extend yourself on your left side; your left leg remains extended, and you raise your right one till it is up to her flank, when you lay her upper leg upon your side. Thus her uppermost leg serves the woman as a support for her back. After having introduced your member you move as you please, and she responds to your action as she pleases."
 carnx_sex_scene_quote_40s: "NINETEENTH MANNER—Tred ech chate (coitus of the sheep). The woman is on her hands and knees; the man, behind her, lifts her thighs till her vulva is on a level with his member, which he then inserts. In this position she ought to place her head between her arms."
 carnx_sex_scene_quote_40t: "TWENTIETH MANNER—Kalen el miche (interchange in coition). The man lies on his back. The woman, gliding in between his legs, places herself upon him with her toe-nails against the ground; she lifts up the man's thighs, turning them against his own body, so that his virile member faces her vulva, into which she guides it; she then places her hands upon the bed by the sides of the man. It is, however, indispensable that the woman's feet rest upon a cushion to enable her to keep her vulva in concordance with his member.\n\nIn this position the parts are exchanged, the woman fulfilling that of the man, and vice-versa."
 carnx_sex_scene_quote_40u: "TWENTY-FIRST MANNER—Rekeud el aïr (the race of the member). The man, on his back, supports himself with a cushion under his shoulders, but his posterior must retain contact with the bed. Thus placed, he draws up his thighs until his knees are on a level with his face; then the woman sits down, impaling herself on his member; she must not lie down, but keep seated as if on horseback, the saddle being represented by the knees and the stomach of the man. In that position she can, by the play of her knees, work up and down and down and up. She can also place her knees on the bed, in which case the man accentuates the movement by plying his thighs, whilst she holds with her left hand on to his right shoulder."
 carnx_sex_scene_quote_40v: "TWENTY-SECOND MANNER—El modakheli (the fitter-in). The woman is seated on her coccyx, with only the points of her buttocks touching the ground; the man takes the same position, her vulva facing his member. Then the woman puts her right thigh over the left thigh of the man, whilst he on his part puts his right thigh over her left one.\n\nThe woman, seizing with her hands her partner's arms, gets his member into her vulva; and each of them leaning alternately a little back, and holding each other by the upper part of the arms, they initiate a swaying movement, moving with little concussions, and keeping their movements in exact rhythm by the assistance of their heels. which are resting on the ground."
 carnx_sex_scene_quote_40w: "TWENTY-THIRD MANNER—El khouariki (the one who stops at home). he woman being couched on her back, the man lies down upon her, with cushions held in his hands.\n\nAfter his member is in, the woman raises her buttocks as high as she can off the bed, the man following her up with his member well inside; then the woman lowers herself again upon the bed, giving some short shocks, and although they do not embrace, the man must stick like glue to her. This movement they continue, but the man must make himself light and must not be ponderous, and the bed must be soft; in default of which the exercise cannot be kept up without break."
 carnx_sex_scene_quote_40x: "TWENTY-FOURTH MANNER—Nik el haddadi (the coition of the blacksmith). The woman lies on her back with a cushion under her buttocks, and her knees raised as far as possible towards her chest, so that her vulva stands out as a target; she then guides her partner's member in.\n\nThe man executes for some time the usual action of coition, then draws his tool out of the vulva, and glides it for a moment between the thighs of the woman, as the smith withdraws the glowing iron from the furnace in order to plunge it into cold water. This manner is called sferdgeli, position of the quince."
 carnx_sex_scene_quote_40y: "TWENTY-FIFTH MANNER—El moheundi (the seducer). The woman lying on her back, the man sits between her legs, with his croupe on his feet; then he raises and separates the women's thighs, placing her legs under his arms, or over his shoulders; he then takes her round the waist, or seizes her shoulders."
 carnx_sex_scene_quote_40z: "It cannot be gainsaid that the Indians have surmounted the greatest difficulties in respect to coition. As a grand exploit, originating with them, the following may be cited:\n\nThe woman being stretched out on her back, the man sits down on her chest, with his back turned to her face, his knees turned forward and his nails gripping the ground; he then raises her hips, arching her back until he has brought her vulva face to face with his member, which he then inserts, and thus gains his purpose."

 carnx_sex_scene_quote_41a: "FIRST MOVEMENT—Neza el dela (the bucket in the well). The man and woman join in close embrace after the introduction. Then he gives a push, and withdraws a little; the woman follows him with a push, and also retires. So they continue their alternate movement, keeping proper time. Placing foot against foot, and hand against hand, they keep up the motion of a bucket in a well."
 carnx_sex_scene_quote_41b: "SECOND MOVEMENT—El netahi (the mutual shock). After the introduction, they each draw back, but without dislodging the member completely. Then they both push tightly together, and thus go on keeping time."
 carnx_sex_scene_quote_41c: "THIRD MOVEMENT—El motadani (the approach). The man moves as usual, and then stops. Then the woman, with the member in her receptacle, begins to move like the man, and then stops. And they continue this way until the ejaculation comes."
 carnx_sex_scene_quote_41d: "FOURTH MOVEMENT—Khiate el heub (love's tailor). The man, with his member being only partially inserted in the vulva, keeps up a sort of quick friction with the part that is in, and then suddenly plunges his whole member in up to its root. This is the movement of the needle in the hands of die tailor, of which the man and woman must take cognisance.\n\nSuch a movement only suits those men and women who can at will retard the crisis. With those wnho are otherwise constituted it would act too quickly."
 carnx_sex_scene_quote_41e: "FIFTH MOVEMENT—Souak el feurdj (the toothpick in the vulva). The man introduces his member between the walls of the vulva, and then drives it up and down, and right and left. Only a man with a very vigorous member can execute this movement."
 carnx_sex_scene_quote_41f: "SIXTH MOVEMENT—Tâhik el heub (the boxing up of love). The man introduces his member entirely into the vagina, so closely that his hairs are completely mixed up with the woman's. In that position he must now move forcibly, without withdrawing his tool in the least.\n\nThis is the best of all the movements, and is particularly well adapted to the position dok el arz. Women prefer it to any other kind, as it procures them the extreme pleasure of seizing the member with their womb; and appeases their lust most completely."

 carnx_sex_scene_quote_48a: "The name of el aïr is derived from el kir (the smith's bellows). In fact if you turn in the latter word the k, kef, so that it faces the opposite way, you will find the word to read el aïr. The member is so called on account of its alternate swelling and subsiding again. If swollen up it stands erect, and if not it sinks down flaccid."
 carnx_sex_scene_quote_48b: "It is called el hamama (the pigeon), because after having been swelled out it resembles at the moment when it returns to repose a pigeon sitting on her eggs."
 carnx_sex_scene_quote_48c: "El teunnana (the tinkler)—So called because every time it enters or comes out of the vulva in coition it makes a noise."
 carnx_sex_scene_quote_48d: "El heurmak (the indomitable)—It has received this name because when in a state of erection it begins to move its head, searching for the entrance to the vulva till it has found it, and it then walks in quite insolently, without asking leave."
 carnx_sex_scene_quote_48e: "El ahlil (the liberator)—Thus called because in penetrating into the vulva of a woman thrice repudiated it gives her the liberty to return to her first husband."
 carnx_sex_scene_quote_48f: "El zeub (the verge)—From the word deub, which means creeping. This name was given to the member because when it gets between a woman's thighs and feels a plump vulva it begins to creep upon the thighs and the Mount of Venus, then approaches the entrance of the vulva, and keeps creeping in until it is in possession and is comfortably lodged, and having it all its own way penetrates into the middle of the vulva, there to ejaculate."
 carnx_sex_scene_quote_48g: "El hammache (the exciter)—It has received this name because it irritates the vulva by its frequent entries and exits."
 carnx_sex_scene_quote_48h: "El nâasse (the sleeper)—From its deceitful appearance. When it gets into erection, it lengthens out and stiffens itself to such an extent that one might think it would never get soft again. But when it has left the vulva, after having satisfied its passion, it goes to sleep.\n\nThere are members that fan asleep while inside the vulva, but the majority of them come out still firm but at that moment they get drowsy, and little by little they go to sleep."
 carnx_sex_scene_quote_48i: "El zoddame (the crowbar)—It is called so because when it meets the vulva and the same will not let it pass in directly, it forces the entrance with its head, breaking and tearing everything, like a wild beast in the rutting season."
 carnx_sex_scene_quote_48j: "El khiade (the tailor)—It takes this name from the circumstance that it does not enter the vulva until it has manoeuvred about the entrance, like a needle in the hand of a tailor, creeping and rubbing against it until it is sufficiently roused, after which it enters."
 carnx_sex_scene_quote_48k: "Mochefi el relil (the extinguisher of passion)—This name is given to a member which is large, strong, and slow to ejaculate; such a member satisfies most completely the amorous wishes of a woman; for, after having wrought her up to the highest pitch, it allays her excitement better than any other. And, in the same way, it calms the ardour of the man. When it wants to get into the vulva, and arriving at the portal finds it closed, it laments, begs and promises: 'Oh! my love! let me come in, I will not stay long.' And when it has been admitted, it breaks its word, and makes a long stay, and does not take its leave till it has satisfied its ardour by the ejaculation of the sperm, coming and going, tilting high and low, and rummaging right and left. The vulva protests, 'How about your word, you deceiver?' she says; 'you said you would only stop in for a moment.' And the member answers, 'Oh, certainly! I shall not retire till I have encountered your womb; but after having found it, I will engage to withdraw at once.' At these words, the vulva takes pity on him, and advances her matrix, which clasps and kisses its head, as if saluting it. 'The member then retires with its passion cooled down."
 carnx_sex_scene_quote_48l: "El khorrate (the turnabout)—This name was given to it because on arriving at the vulva it pretends to come on important business, knocks at the door, turns about everywhere, without shame or bashfulness, investigating every corner to the right and left, forward and backward, and then all at once darts right to the bottom of the vagina for the ejaculation."
 carnx_sex_scene_quote_48m: "El deukkak (the striker)—Thus called because on arriving at the entrance of the vulva it gives a slight knock. If the vulva opens the door, it enters; if there is no response, it begins to knock again, and does not cease until it is admitted. The parasite who wants to get into the house of a rich man to be present at a feast does the same: he knocks at the door; and if it is opened, he walks in; but if there is no response to his knock, he repeats it again and again until the door is opened. And similarly the deukkak with the door of the vulva.\n\nBy 'knocking at the door' is meant the friction of the member against the entrance of the vulva until the latter becomes moist. The appearance of this moisture is the phenomenon alluded to by the expression 'opening the door."
 carnx_sex_scene_quote_48n: "El âouame (the swimmer)—Because when it enters the vulva it does not remain in one favourite place, but, on the contrary, turns to the right, to the left, goes forward, draws back, and then moves like a swimmer in the middle amongst its own sperm and the fluid furnished by the vulva, as if in fear of drowning and trying to save itself."
 carnx_sex_scene_quote_48o: "El dekhal (the housebreaker)—Merits that name because on coming to the door of the vulva this one asks, 'What do you want?' 'I want to come in!' 'Impossible! I cannot take you in on account of your size.' Then the member insists that the other one should only receive its head, promising not to come in entirely; it then approaches, rubs its head twice or thrice between the vulva's lips, till they get humid and thus lubricated, then introduces first its head, and after, with one push, plunges in up to the testicles."
 carnx_sex_scene_quote_48p: "El âouar (the one-eyed)—Because it has but one eye, which eye is not like other eyes, and does not see clearly.\n\nEl fordyce (the bald one)—Because there is no hair on its head, which makes it look bald.\n\nAbou aïne (he with one eye)—It has received this name because it has one eye which presents the peculiarity of being without pupil and eyelashes."
 carnx_sex_scene_quote_48q: "El âtsar (the stumbler)—It is called so because if it wants to penetrate into the vulva but does not see the door, it beats about above and below, bind thus continues to stumble as over stones in the road, until the lips of the vulva get humid, when it manages to get inside. The vulva then says, What has happened to you that made you stumble about so?' The member answers, 'O my love, it was a stone lying in the road.'"
 carnx_sex_scene_quote_48r: "Abou rokba (the one with a neck)—That is the being with a short neck, a well-developed throat, thick at the end, and a bald head, and who, moreover, has coarse and bristly hair from the navel to the pubis.\n\nAbou quetaïa (the hairy one; who has a forest of hail)—This name is given to it when the hair is abundant about it."
 carnx_sex_scene_quote_48s: "El besiss (the impudent one)—It has received this name because from the moment that it gets stiff and long it does not care for anybody, lifts impudently the clothing of its master by raising its head fiercely, and makes him ashamed while itself feels no shame. It acts in the same unabashed way with women, turning up their clothes and laying bare their thighs. Its master may blush at this conduct, but as to itself its stiffness and determination to plunge into a vulva only increase."
 carnx_sex_scene_quote_48t: "El mostahi (the shame-faced one)—This sort of member which is met with sometimes, is capable of feeling ashamed and timid when facing a vulva which it does not know, and it is only after a little time that it gets bolder and stiffens. Sometimes it is even so much troubled that it remains incompetent for the coitus, which happens in particular when a stranger is present, in which case it becomes quite incapable of moving."
 carnx_sex_scene_quote_48u: "El bekkaï (the weeper)—So called on account of the many tears it sheds: as soon as it gets m erection, it weeps; when it sees a pretty face, it weeps; handling a woman, it weeps. It goes even so far as to weep tears sacred to memory.\n\nEl hezzaz (the rummager)—It is named thus because as soon as it penetrates into the vulva it begins to rummage about vigorously, until it has appeased its passion.\n\nEl lezzaz (the unionist)—Received that name because as soon as it is in the vulva it pushes and works till fur meets fur, and even makes efforts to force the testicles into it."
 carnx_sex_scene_quote_48v: "Abou lâaba (the expectorant)—Has received this name because when coming near a vulva, or when it sees one, or even when merely thinking of it, or when its master touches a woman or plays with her or kisses her, its saliva begins to move and it has tears in its eye; this saliva is particularly abundant when it has been for some time out of work, and it will even wet then his master's dress. This member is very common, and there are but few people who are not furnished with it.\n\nThe liquid it sheds is cited by lawyers under the name of medi. Its production is the result of toyings and of lascivious thoughts. With some people it is so abundant as to fill the vulva, so that they erroneously believe that it comes from the woman."
 carnx_sex_scene_quote_48w: "El fattache (the searcher)—From its habit, when in the vulva, of turning in every direction as if in search of something; and that something is the matrix. It will know no rest until it has found it.\n\nEl hakkak (the rubber)—It has got this name because it will not enter the vagina until it has rubbed its head against the entrance and the lower part of the belly. It is frequently mistaken for the next one."
 carnx_sex_scene_quote_48x: "El mokcheuf (the discoverer)—Has been thus denominated because in getting up and raising its head, it raises the vestments which hide it, and uncovers its master's nudities, and because it is also not afraid to lay bare the vulvas which it does not yet know, and to lift up the clothes which cover them without shame. It is not accessible to any sense of bashfulness, cares for nothing and respects nothing. Nothing which concerns the coitus is strange to it; it has a profound knowledge of vulvas state of humidity, freshness, dryness, rightness or warmth of vulvas which it explores assiduously. There are, in fact, certain vulvas o exquisite exterior, plump and fine outside, whose insides leave much to wish for, and they give no pleasure, owing to their being not warm, but very humid, and having other similar faults. It is for this reason that the mokcheuf tries to find out about things concerning the coitus, and received this name."

Such a vulva is very plump and round in every direction, with long lips, grand slit, the edges well divided and symmetrical and rounded; it is soft, seductive, perfect throughout. It is the most pleasant and no doubt the best of all the different sorts. May God grant 'is the possession of such a vulva! Amen. It is warm, tight, and dry; so much so that one might expect to see fire burst from it. Its form is graceful, its odour pleasant; the whiteness of its outside sets off its carmine-red middle. There is no imperfection about it."
 carnx_sex_scene_quote_49b: "El kehmoune (the voluptuous)—The name given to the vulva of a young virgin.\n\nEl ass (the primitive)—This is a name applicable to every kind of vulva.\n\nEl zerzour (the starling)—The vulva of a very young girl, or, as others pretend, of a brunette.\n\nEl cheukk (the chink)—The vulva of a bony, lean woman. It is like a chink in a wall, with not a vestige of flesh. May God keep us from it!"
 carnx_sex_scene_quote_49c: "Abou tertour (the crested one)—It is the name given to a vulva furnished with a red comb, like that of a cock, which rises at the moment of enjoyment.\n\nAbou khochime (the snub-nose)—Is a vulva with thin lips and a small tongue.\n\nEl gueunfond (the hedgehog)—The vulva of the old, decrepit woman, dried up with age and with bristly hail.\n\nEl sakouti (the silent one)—This name has been given to the vulva that is noiseless. The member may enter it a hundred times a day but it will not say a word, and will be content to look on without a murmur."
 carnx_sex_scene_quote_49d: "El deukkak (the crusher)—So called from its crushing movements upon the member. It generally begins to push the member, directly it enters, to the right and to the left, and to grip it with the matrix, and would, if it could, absorb also the two testicles."
 carnx_sex_scene_quote_49e: "El tseguil (the importunate)—This is the vulva which is never tired of taking in the member. This latter might pass a hundred nights with it, and walk in a hundred times every night, still that vulva would not be sated—nay, it would want still more, and would not allow the member to come out again at all, if it was possible. With such a vulva the parts are exchanged; the vulva is the pursuer, the member the pursued. Luckily it is a rarity, and only found in a small number of women, who are wild with passion, all on fire, and in flame."
 carnx_sex_scene_quote_49f: "El taleb (the yearning one)—This vagina is met with in a few women only. With some it is natural; with others it becomes what it is by long abstinence. It is burning for a member, and, having got one in its embrace, it refuses to part with it until its fire is completely extinguished."
 carnx_sex_scene_quote_49g: "El hacene (the beautiful)—This is the vulva which is white, plump, in form vaulted like a dome, firm, and without any deformity. You cannot take your eyes off it, and to look at it changes a feeble erection into a strong one."
 carnx_sex_scene_quote_49h: "El neuffakh (the swelling one)—So called because a torpid member coming near it, and rubbing its head against it a few times, at once swells and stands upright. To the woman who has such a one it procures excessive pleasure, for, at the moment of the crisis, it opens and shuts convulsively, like the vulva of a mare."
 carnx_sex_scene_quote_49i: "Abou djebaha (one with a projection)—Some women have this sort of vulva, which is very large, with a pubis prominent like a projecting, fleshy forehead."
 carnx_sex_scene_quote_49j: "El ouasâ (the vast one)—A vulva surrounded by a very large pubis. Women of that build are said to be of large vagina, because, although on the approach of the member it appears find and impenetrable to such a degree that not even a meroud seems likely to be passed in, as soon as it feels the friction of the glans against its centre it opens wide at once."
 carnx_sex_scene_quote_49k: "El aride (the large one)—This is the vulva which is as wide as it is long; that is to say, fully developed all round, from side to side, and from the pubis to the perineum. It is the most beautiful to look upon."
 carnx_sex_scene_quote_49l: "Abou Belâoum (the glutton)—The vulva with a vast capacity for swallowing. If such a vulva has not been able to get coitus for some time it fairly engulf the member that then comes near it, without leaving any trace of it outside, like as a man who is famished flings himself upon viands that are offered to him, and would swallow them without mastication."
 carnx_sex_scene_quote_49m: "El mokâour (the bottomless)—This is the vagina of indefinite length, having, in consequence, the matrix lying very far back. It requires a member of the largest dimensions; any other could not succeed in rousing its amorous sensibilities."
 carnx_sex_scene_quote_49n: "Abou cheufrine (the two-lipped)—This name is given to the amply developed vagina of an excessively stout woman. Also to the vagina the lips of which having become flaccid, owing to weakness, are long and pendulous."
 carnx_sex_scene_quote_49o: "Abou âungra (the humpbacked)—This vulva has the mount of Venus prominent and hard, standing out like the hump on the back of the camel, and reaching down between the thighs like the head of a calf. May God let us enjoy such a vulva! Amen!"
 carnx_sex_scene_quote_49p: "El rorbal (the sieve)—This vulva on receiving a member seems to sift it all over, below, right and left, fore and aft, until the moment of pleasure arrives."
 carnx_sex_scene_quote_49q: "El hezzaz (the restless)—When this vagina has received the member it begins to move violently and without interruption until the member touches the matrix, and then knows no repose till it has hastened on the enjoyment and finished its world."
 carnx_sex_scene_quote_49r: "El lezzaz (the unionist)—The vagina which, having taken in the member, clings to it and pushes itself forward upon it so closely that, if the thing were possible, it would enfold the two testicles."
 carnx_sex_scene_quote_49s: "El moudd (the accommodating)—This name is applied to the vagina of a woman who has felt for a long time an ardent wish for coition. In rapture with the member it sees, it is glad to second its movements of come and go; it offers its matrix to the member by pressing it forward within reach, which is, after all, the best gift it can offer. Whatever place inside of it the member wants to explore, this vulva will make him welcome to, gracefully according to its wish; there is no corner it will not help the member to reach."
 carnx_sex_scene_quote_49t: "El mouâïne (the assistant)—This vulva is thus named because it assists the member to go in and out, to go up and down, in short, in all its movements, in such a way that if it desires to do a thing, to enter or to retire, to move about, etc., the vulva hastens to give it all facilities, and answers to its appeal. By this aid the ejaculation is facilitated, and the enjoyment heightened."
 carnx_sex_scene_quote_49u: "El meusboul (the long one)—This name applies only to some vulvas; everyone knows that vulvas are far from being all of the same conformation and aspect This vulva extends from the pubis to the anus. It lengthens out when the woman is lying down or standing, and contracts when she is sitting, differing in this respect from the vulva of a round shape. It looks like a splendid cucumber lying between the thighs. With some women it shows projecting under light clothing, or when they are bending back."
 carnx_sex_scene_quote_49v: "El molki (the duellist)—This is the vulva which, on the introduction of a member, executes the movement of coming and going, pushes itself upon it for fear of its retiring before the pleasure arrives. There is no enjoyment for it but the shock given to its matrix by the member, and it is for this that it projects its matrix to grip and suck the member's gland when the ejaculation takes place. Certain vulvas, wild with desire and lust, be it natural or a consequence of long abstention, throw themselves upon the approaching member, opening the mouth like a famished infant to whom the mother offers the breast. In the same way this vulva advances and retires upon the member to bring it face to face with the matrix, as if in fear that, unaided, it could not find the same.\n\nThe vulva and the member resemble thus two skilful duellists, each time that one of them rushes its antagonist, the latter opposes its shield to parry the blow and repulse the assault. The member represents the sword, and the matrix the shield. The one who first ejaculates the sperm is vanquished; while the one who is slowest is the victor; and, assuredly, it is a fine fight! I should like thus to fight without stopping to the day of my death."
 carnx_sex_scene_quote_49w: "El harrab (the fugitive)—The vagina which, being very tight and short, is hurt by the penetration of a very large and soft member; it tries to escape to the right and left. It is thus, people say, like the vagina of most virgins, which, not yet having made the acquaintance of the member and fearful of its approach, tries to get out of its way when it glides in between the thighs and wants to be admitted."
 carnx_sex_scene_quote_49x: "El sabeur (the resigned)—This is the vulva which, having admitted the member, submits patiently to all its whims, and movements. It is also said that this vulva is strong enough to suffer resignedly the most violent and prolonged coitus. If it were assaulted a hundred times it would not be vexed or annoyed; and instead of venting reproaches, it would give thanks to God. It will show the same patience if it has to do with several members who visit it successively.\n\nThis kind of vagina is found in women of a glowing temperament. If they only knew how to do it, they would not allow the man to dismount, nor his member to retire for a single moment."
 carnx_sex_scene_quote_49y: "El mouseuffah (the barred one)—This kind of vagina is not often met with. The defect which distinguished it is sometimes natural, sometimes it is the result of an unskilfully executed operation of circumcision upon the woman. It can happen that the operator makes a false move with his instrument and injures the two lips, or even only one of them. In healing there forms a thick scar, which bars the passage, and in order to make the vagina accessible to the member, a surgical operation and the use of the bistouri will have to be resorted to."
 carnx_sex_scene_quote_49z: "El merour (the deep one)—The vagina which always has the mouth open, and the bottom of which is beyond sight. The longest members only can reach it."
 carnx_sex_scene_quote_49aa: "El âddad (the biter)—The vulva which, when the member has got into it and is burning with passion, opens and shuts again upon the same fiercely. It is chiefly when the ejaculation is coming that the man feels the head of his member bitten by the mouth of the matrix. And certainly there is an attractive power in the same when it clings, yearning for sperm, to the gland, and draws it in as far as it can. If God in his power has decreed that the woman shall become pregnant the sperm gets concentrated in the matrix, where it is gradually vivified; but if, on the contrary, God does not permit the conception, the matrix expels the seed, which then runs over the vagina."
 carnx_sex_scene_quote_49ab: "El meusass (the sucker)—This is a vagina which in its amorous heat in consequence of voluptuous toyings, or of long abstinence, begins to suck the member which has entered it so forcibly as to deprive it of all its sperm, dealing with it as a child drawing on the breast of the mother."
 carnx_sex_scene_quote_49ac: "El zeunbour (the wasp)—This kind of vulva is known by the strength and roughness of its fur. When the member approaches and tries to enter it gets stung by the hairs as if by a wasp."
 carnx_sex_scene_quote_49ad: "El harr (the hot one)—This is one of the most praiseworthy vulvas. Warmth is in fact very much esteemed in a vulva, and it may be said that the intensity of the enjoyment afforded by it is in proportion to the heat it develops."
 carnx_sex_scene_quote_49ae: "El ladid (the delicious)—It has the reputation of procuring an unexampled pleasure, comparable only to the one felt by the beasts and birds of prey, and for which they fight sanguinary combats. And if such effects are produced upon animals, what must they be for man? And so it is that all wars spring from the search for the voluptuous pleasure which the vagina procures, and which is the highest fortune of this world; it is a part of the delights of paradise awarded to us by God as a foretaste of what is waiting for us, namely, delights a thousand times superior, and above which only the sight of the Benevolent (God) is to be placed."

 carnx_sex_scene_quote_50a: "As the poet said:\n\nIt has the splendid whiteness of a forehead,\nIn its dimensions it is like the moon,\nThe fire that radiates from it is like the sun's,\nAnd seems to burn the member which approaches;\nUnless first moistened with saliva the member cannot enter,\nThe odour it emits is full of charms."
 carnx_sex_scene_quote_50b: "The poets have described it in the following verse:\n\nShe—the woman shows in turning up her robe\nAn object—the vulva—developed full and round,\nIn semblance like a cup turned upside down.\nIn placing thereupon your hand, you seem to feel\nA well-formed bosom, springy, firm, and full.\nIn boring in your lance it gets well bitten,\nAnd drawn in by a suction, as the breast is by a child.\nAnd after having finished, if you wish to recommence,\nYou'll find it flaming hot as any furnace."
 carnx_sex_scene_quote_50c: "Another poet (may God grant all his wishes in Paradise!) has composed on the same theme the following lines:\n\nLike to a man extended on his chest, she—the vulva—fills the hand\nWhich has to be well stretched to cover it.\nThe place it occupies is standing forth\nLike an unopened bud of the blossom of a plum tree.\nAssuredly the smoothness of its skin\nIs like the beardless cheek of adolescence;\nIts conduit is but narrow,\nThe entrance to it is not easy,\nAnd he who essays to get in\nFeels as though he was butting against a coat of mail.\nAnd at the introduction it emits a sound\nLike to the tearing of a woven stuff.\nThe member having filled its cavity,\nReceives the lively welcome of a bite,\nSuch as the nipple of the nurse receives\nWhen placed between the nursling's lips for suction.\nIts lips are burning,\nLike a fire that is lighted,\nAnd how sweet it is, this fire!\nHow delicious for me."
 carnx_sex_scene_quote_50d: "Poets have praised it in the following verses:\n\nThe vulva possesses an intrinsic heat;\nShut in a solid heart (interior) and pent up breast (matrix).\nIts fire communicates itself to him that enters it;\nIt equals in intensity the fire of love.\nShe is as tight as a well-fitting shoe,\nSmaller than the circle of the apple of the eye."

 carnx_sex_scene_quote_52a: "Again I profited by this moment to admire the beauties of her vulva. It was magnificent, its purple centre setting off its whiteness all the more. It was round, and without any imperfection; projecting like a splendidly curved dome over her belly. In one word, it was a masterpiece of creation as fine as could be seen. The blessing of God, the best creator, upon it."
 carnx_sex_scene_quote_52b: "Seeing her then in such transports, trembling like a bird, the throat of which is being cut, I pushed my dart into her. Thinking she might not be able to take in the whole of my member, I had entered cautiously, but she moved her buttocks furiously, saying to me, 'This is not enough for my contentment.' Making a strong push, I lodged my member completely in her, which made her utter a painful cry, but the moment after she moved with greater fury than before. She cried, 'Do not miss the comers, neither high nor low, but above all things do not neglect the centre! The centre!' she repeated. 'If you feel it coming, let it go into my matrix so as to extinguish my fire.' Then we moved alternately in and out, which was delicious. Our legs were interlaced, our muscles unbent, and so we went on with kisses and claspings until the crisis came upon us simultaneously. We then rested and took breath after this mutual conflict."
 carnx_sex_scene_quote_52c: "She gave me now a piece of an aromatic root, which she recommended me to keep in my mouth, assuring me that as long as I had it there my member would remain on the alert. Then she asked me to lie down, which I did. She mounted upon me, and taking my member into her hands, she made it enter entirely into her vagina. I was astonished at the vigour of her vulva and at the heat emitted from it. The opening of her matrix in particular excited my admiration. I never had any experience like it; it closely clasped my member and pinched the gland.\n\nWith the exception of Fadehat el Djemal no woman had until then taken in my member to its full length. She was able to do so, I believe, owing to her being very plump and corpulent, and her vulva being large and deep."
 carnx_sex_scene_quote_52d: "Fadehat el Djemal, astride upon me, began to rise and descend; she kept crying out, wept, went slower, then accelerated her movements again, ceased to move altogether; when part of my member became visible she looked at it' then took it out altogether to examine it closely, then plunged it in again until it had appeared completely. So she continued until the enjoyment overcame her again."

 carnx_sex_scene_quote_55a: "There are women who will do their husband's behests, and will satisfy them and give them voluptuous pleasure by coition, only if compelled by blows and ill-treatment. Some people ascribe this conduct to the aversion they feel either against coition or against the husband; but this is not so; it is simply a question of temperament and character."
 carnx_sex_scene_quote_55b: "There are also women who do not care for coition because all their ideas turn upon the grandeurs, personal honours, ambitious hopes, or business cares of the world. With others this indifference springs, as it may be, from purity of the heart, or from jealousy, or from a pronounced tendency of their souls towards another world, or lastly from past violent sorrows."
 carnx_sex_scene_quote_55c: "The woman of a jealous disposition and the woman who raises her voice so as to drown that of her husband; she who disseminates scandal; the woman that scowls; the one who is always burning to let men see her beauty, and cannot stay at home; and with respect to this last let me add that a woman who laughs much, and is constantly seen at the street door, may be taken to be an arrant prostitute."
